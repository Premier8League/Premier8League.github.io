title: Python长字符串换行方式
---

* **需求分析：** python代码中用到长字符串，出于代码阅读的简洁性，希望将其分行(不加换行符)
```python
example = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be."
```

* **解决方案：**

1.使用反斜线(backslash)'\\'
```python
example1 = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. "\
    "What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. "\
    "Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, "\
    "whatever the case may be."
```
测试结果如下：
![example1]({{ https://premier8league.github.io/ }}/assets/pics/example1.jpg)

2.字符串拼接
```python
example2 = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. "
example2 += "What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. "
example2 += "Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, "
example2 += "whatever the case may be."
```
没什么好解释的~
