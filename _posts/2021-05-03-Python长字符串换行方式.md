title: Python长字符串换行方式
---

* **需求分析：** Python代码中用到长字符串，出于代码阅读的简洁性，希望将其分行(不加换行符)
```python
example = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, whatever the case may be."
```

* **解决方案：**

1. <u>使用反斜线'\'</u>
    ```python
    example1 = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. "\
        "What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. "\
        "Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, "\
        "whatever the case may be."
    ```
    测试结果如下：
    ![example1]({{premier8league.github.io}}/assets/pics/example1.jpg)

2. <u>字符串拼接</u>
    ```python
    example2 = "If you want to be great at something, there’s a choice you have to make. "
    example2 += "What I mean by that is, there are inherent sacrifices that come along with that. "
    example2 += "Family time, hanging out with friends, being a great friend, being a great son, nephew, "
    example2 += "whatever the case may be."
    ```
    没什么好解释的~

3. <u>长字符串作为参数时的特殊写法</u>

    见下例：

    ![example3-1]({{premier8league.github.io}}/assets/pics/example3-1.jpg)

    【注意！】这种书写方式不能用于普通字符串变量的定义：

    ![example3-2]({{premier8league.github.io}}/assets/pics/example3-2.jpg)
